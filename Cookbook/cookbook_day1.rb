# ------ COOKBOOK DAY 1

# MVC - Model View Controller

# frontend is everything that faces the customer; backend everything that customer cant see

# single responsibility principle - you want each class to be specialized

# router only asks which CRUD action user wants to take; view takes care of anything inside CRUD actions (asking which to delete, create etc
